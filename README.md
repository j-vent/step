This repo contains the projects you'll work on for the first half of STEP.
This work is based on the [Google Software Product Sprint](https://g.co/softwareproductsprint) program.

To get started:

- Login to [Google Cloud Shell](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor)
- Clone this repo: `cd; git clone https://github.com/googleinterns/step.git`
- Open the GitHub setup walkthrough: `teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-1-setup/github-setup-walkthrough.md`
  - If the tutorial panel does not open or display the walkthrough contents, try refreshing the page.

Then follow the on-screen instructions to set up your repo.
