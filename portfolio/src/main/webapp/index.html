      <p>Welcome to my portfolio!</p>
      <p>My name is Justine and I am an incoming third year student in Software Engineering. I study at the University of Alberta, in my hometown of Edmonton, Canada. Technically it's my
          secondary hometown as I am originally from Manila, Philippines and my family immigrated to Canada when I was 8 y/o. I have dabbled in many areas of CS but I really enjoy web dev and Java dev. 
          I am also interested in machine learning and computer vision. Currently I am a STEP intern at Google, and I am excited to develop these skills and learn more about web dev in general.
      </p>
      <p>In my free time I like to relax by playing acoustic guitar and playing Overcooked! and CS:GO with my friends. In pre-Corona times I also liked trying new restaurants in my city with friends.
          A fun fact about myself is that I can play five instruments: piano, guitar, tenor saxophone, ukulele, and harmonica. But I can't play the last 3 very well. Other things I'm interested in are
          trivia (I played on my high school's team and I'd love to be on Jeopardy! someday), makeup, and cooking.
